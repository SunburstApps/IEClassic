# IEClassic

This repository contains a Windows-based Web browser that uses the legacy Microsoft
Internet Explorer layout engine to render Web pages. It is designed primarily for use
intranet websites that will not work properly with any other Web browser. The code
for IEClassic is primarily derived from the Wine Internet Explorer codebase, albeit
greatly edited to modernize it, and to make it work side-by-side with Windows 10 and
Microsoft Internet Explorer.

This repository is primarily licensed under the LGPLv3, although it contains code from
a number of different sources. Additional LICENSE files may found within several different
subdirectories of this codebase, which give licensing terms for the contents of those
subdirectories. (I have used the "or later" clause of Wine's licensing to license the
entire project under LGPLv3 instead of LGPLv2.)
